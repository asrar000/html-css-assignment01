## Overview of Structure and Approach

This is a single page vacation hotel room rental website created using **Vanilla HTML and CSS** (no frameworks).

I designed the page with a clear, logical flow that works well on both desktop and mobile devices:

Header
    A clean white header containing the logo and navigation menu (with a mobile hamburger toggle).
Breadcrumb
    A subtle gray bar showing the user's current location in the site hierarchy (e.g., Park Shore Rentals > USA > Florida > Destin).
Main Content Area
    The layout splits into two columns on desktop:
    Left column (main content):
        Property title and key details (rating, bedrooms, bathrooms, guests)
        Image gallery (one large main image + two smaller thumbnails)
        Brief property description with a "Show more" button
        Location section with text info and an embedded Google Maps iframe
    Right column (sticky booking card):
        The booking sidebar stays fixed in place while scrolling (until it reaches the footer), making it easy for users to check prices and availability at any time.
Reviews Section
    A dedicated white section below the main content displaying customer reviews in a responsive grid (3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile).
Footer
    A dark footer with categorized links, legal information, and copyright details.

This structure ensures a smooth user experience: visitors see the most important information (images, description, and booking options) right away, while the sticky sidebar keeps the call-to-action always accessible without feeling intrusive.
